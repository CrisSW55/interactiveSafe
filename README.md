# interactiveSafe
This project consists of using Java programming language, Java Swing, and Java AWT to make an interactive GUI safe. 

My Learning:
I am learning to use the Java Swing and AWT libraries. They contain the layout to place each component on the window or current component. Also, they contain many GUI properites and functions that I may use. Also, the Java String class I would use the methods to check the correct code the user inputs. 

Project Use:
The user would utilize the keyPad to input four digit code that should coincide with the final String code in the KeyPad class.
